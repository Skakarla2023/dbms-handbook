# DBMS

- Database Management System (DBMS) is a software used to manage data from a database.

  - A database is a structured collection of data that is stored in an electronic device. The data can be text, video, image or any other format.
  - A relational database stores data in the form of tables and a NoSQL database in the form of key-value pairs.
  - SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for accessing and manipulating data in a relational database.
  - A DBMS is a software that allows to create, update and retrieval of data in an organized way. It also provides security to the database.
  - Examples of relational DBMS are MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, Postgre SQL and Snowflake.
  - Examples of NoSQL DBMS are MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB and Redis.

### Problems with Traditional File-Based Systems

Before the introduction of modern DBMS, data was managed using basic file systems on hard drives. While this approach allowed users to store, retrieve and update files as needed, it came with numerous challenges

1. Data Redundancy: Duplicate entries across files
2. Inconsistency: Conflicting or outdated information
3. Difficult Access: Manual file search required
4. Poor Security: No control over data access
5. Single-User Access: No support for collaboration
6. No Backup/Recovery: Data loss was often permanent
